<h1>About Johnny Waller</h1>

    <p>The army hasn't given me any further news in regard to my army service but I'll be ready when they are.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I've been over the obstacle course every week since I entered the army. It isn't troublesome for young fellows, but some of the older men have a little difficulty. You start off by climbing an eight foot wall. This is followed by a series of climbing and jumping obstacles. About the middle of the course is a tunnel which would stick anyone the size of my uncle. Even I have trouble squeezing through. Down the home stretch are some four foot hurdles and a stream which you have to swing across on a rope. I've seen more than one take a dunking. The last obstacle is hardest. You have to go hand over hand on overhead bars stretched across a small pond. Some of the bars are at least three feet apart, so you can see it's no joke. This life is making me feel better physically though, and also adding weight. I've gained about twelve pounds so far.</p>

<h2>Deployment to Britain</h2>
<p>In May 1944, Waller was sent to England. Upon his arrival, he sent letters home to his friend Geraldine Rowbottom, in which he described his surroundings and experiences.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>I've never seen such changeable weather as that which we have to put up with here. As the captain told us when we first arrived, "When you can see the hills, it's going to rain. When you can't see the hills, it's raining." There's more truth than fiction in that statement.</p>
