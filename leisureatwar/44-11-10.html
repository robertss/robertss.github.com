		<p>Dear Geraldine,</p>

		<p>Well toots this probably won't be much of a letter but I'm in the mood news or no news. I've just finished a letter to a friend of my mothers whose boy, a pal of mine, is over here too. She hasn't been hearing from him much so I thought a letter from old Wall might help a little. We look somewhat alike except that he's an inch or so taller plus a few pounds heavier. I, by the way, have lost quite a little weight. The major told me this morning that I could stand ten pounds easily. I replied that feeling well was more important than being robust. I could stand some pounds though, I know.
</p>

		<p>Interesting letter don't you think, but I warned you that I had no news. I forgot to mention that I was released from the hospital two days ago in the late afternoon. Aside from being low on stamina I'm in pretty good shape.</p>

		<p>I took a walk into town last night with one of the sergeants and nearly 'pooped' myself going up these doggone hills. I didn't realize my legs were so weak. To make a long story short, we spent an enjoyable two hours up in Mabel's room. That by the way is the name of the picture we saw. I didn't capitalize it as you notice. Poor joke, I guess.</p>

		<p>Coming back, we bought a train ticket for two pence to save walking. It was a four minute ride but well worth the price to escape the chill winds that blow down from these hills.</p>

		<p>I wish I could take you for a walk up one of these hills. You get a wonderful view from the top and the hike up is fun too.</p>

	<p>Pardon me if I digress for a minute but every time I look at the snap of you leaning against a log, you look prettier. Someone is going to be mighty lucky some day and I don't mean maybe & don't tell me I'm nuts.</p>

	<p>One of the fellows on the train has a camera so I may be able to send you an up-to-date snap sometime soon. We have a place where we can develop pictures so I'm hoping to get in a little darkroom work. The first developing I ever did was in Ft. Wayne and it made a big hit with me although my results weren't exactly professional.</p>

<p>This morning, the hills were white with frost. It remained very cool all day with a thin ice film over any stray puddles of water. We'll soon be putting on long johns if this keeps up.</p>

<p>You know, I could gab on and on to-night but I guess I better hit the bunk instead. You better watch out for my letters when I once get your answer to that little question no matter which way you answer it.</p>

<p>Now, I'll say good nite to my favorite correspondent. Don't work too hard. Hoping to hear from you soon, I still remain,</p>

		<p class="sig">As ever,</p>
		<p class="sig">Johnny</p> 
		<p>P.S. Is this how you got your job in the bank. heh heh!</p>
