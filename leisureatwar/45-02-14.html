	<h1>February 14, 1945</h1>
		<p>In this letter, Johnny describes the events going on with his hospital train unit, including a speech from the major, chatting with the nurses, dental appointments, and physical inspections. He also comments on the beauty of the stars, and asks Geraldine about her hair styles and notes that his own sense of style is unusual.</p> <!--summary of letter-->

		<p>Wed. Eve 9:30 PM</p>

		<p>Hello Honey,</p>

		<p>Another day in the army, one nearer the end of the war and you.</p>

		<p>We've been in from our run about an hour and half now. The major gave us a little speech while we were eating chow on the way back. He told us this had been one of our most difficult runs and he wanted to congratulate us on the way we did our work. An occasional pat on the back helps you know. It's good psychology too.</p>

		<p>We started out about eleven o'clock last nite and got back here at eight o'clock this evening. There were quite a few Wacs, Nurses and Red Cross girls on this trip. They're nice to talk to but the medics cuss them for the attention they want.</p>

		<p>To-morrow, I have to go over to the hospital for some dental work. I haven't had any work done on my teeth since I came in the army. I have a couple of faulty fillings which have to be replaced - other than that they seem to be holding up O.K. under army chow.</p>

		<p>To-morrow also, Paul (717th) and I have to take a physical to determine whether or not we are suitable candidates for the infantry. It's just a matter of form that all non-combat troops have to go through. Actually, there is no such thing as non-combat when you're in the thick of things. My outfit all have rifles and carbines, (I have a carbine) besides a flock of machine guns. They aren't supposed to fight unless they have to and the unless might as well be left out. Don't worry though honey, as Paul and I are not with our outfit at the present time.</p>

		<p>You know, to-day was almost like a spring day at home. I'm already beginning to get spring fever and here it is just the start of Lent. To-day was Ash Wednesday, a fact which I didn't remember until we were served fish for chow. (I was reminded by one of the catholic boys). I guess I'll try to be a little more even tempered - not so many darns in my days conversation.</p>
	
		<p>To-night is a beautiful conclusion to a beautiful day. There seem to be a million stars visible, although, according to mathematicians, the human eye can see only about seventy-five hundred. No doubt you can imagine the kind of night it is. If I were with you I wouldn't be bothered remembering just how many stars I was looking at simply because I'd be looking at you instead - You with the moonlight forming highlights on that pretty head of yours. Moonlight always did become you little one. Speaking of moonlite, here's a scientific observation from the Stars & Stripes. The moon affects the tide and untied. One more remark from the same source. Who said that? When one woman is talking it's a monologue. When two women are talking it's a cat-alogue.</p>
	
		<p>Say Jerry, are you doing your hair differently? I notice in the last snaps you sent me you have a little wave in the front and curled out at both sides of your face. In the other snaps I have it is fluffed up about equally on top and sides. You can't really judge by a photograph which is better, however. I could soon tell if I had you here beside me. Both ways you are pretty but I can't tell which I like better. I can imagine about how much influence my opinion would bear judging from some of the remarks I used to get from my sister or are you different. I'll have to admit if it were me I'd probably wear it any way I damned pleased with the remark that after all I was the one who had to wear it.</p>
	
		<p>I guess I'm 'sorta' an individualist at least in some respects. At any rate, I was the only fellows in our church who wore a sport coat up to the altar for communion. I like sport clothes so I wear them all the time at home. To tell the truth, I only own one suit, all the rest are sport coats with odd slacks. Still, I remember you as being a lover of skirts and blouses. Perhaps you've outgrown that by now. Boy you talk about your going on and on - how about me?</p>
	
		<p>Well honey, I think I'll call it a day for this time. Don't work too hard. Still missing and loving you, I remain,</p>

		<p class="sig">With all my love,</p>
		<p class="sig">Johnny</p>
