<h1>January 20, 1945</h1>
	<p>In the first part of this letter, Johnny mentions a picture that he's sending to Geraldine (presumably the picture shows him in his uniform) and other photographs that he's been developing. In the second part, he tells a lengthy story about his most recent trip to the town and his adventures at the local pub.</p> <!--summary of letter-->

		<p>Dearest Geraldine,</p>

		<p>Well honey, we're on our return journey from the long run I told you we were making. Needless to say we are all pretty tired. The scenery was beautiful this trip due to about a three inch snowfall which blanketed everything in white. It's too bad the world isn't as clean as snow makes it appear—don't you agree.</p>

		<p>I'm sending you a picture I had taken in the PX (post exchange). It's an untouched enlargement from a 35mm. negative so you'll see me as I am. Whether it will reach you as soon as this letter does I can't say but at least you'll know it's on the way. I hope you like it.</p>

		<p>The supply corporal and I also spent a couple of hours after chow this evening printing pictures with the new contact printer I mentioned before. There is only one snap with me in it, and that is a group picture. I'll probably enclose one with my next epistle. You know we are rolling along as I write this so don't think I've been on a binge if you can't read my scrawl.</p>

		<p>The train is very cold to-night for some reason or other. The steam doesn't seem to be coming through as it should. The major got after the engineer once, however, it doesn't seem to be any better yet. The only thing to do is hit the sack which I'm going to do right now. I'll finish this in the morning so until then I'll say goodnite sweetheart. (Too bad I can't kiss you good-nite)</p>

		<p>1/23/45</p>

		<p>A little more time elapsed than I intended in finishing this letter but anyway here I am again. Sunday the train was in all day so we had the day off. Three of us attended church in town, came back for chow, and then went out for the rest of the day and evening.</p>

		<p>We met a couple of more of our buddies at the Red Cross where coffee with doughnuts was serving as our supper. They went out together but the three of us ran into them later in the evening again.</p>

		<p>After they had left, Paul, Lea and I decided to raise a little hell as we were in the mood so we started off on a round of the pubs. Maybe I better explain that a pub over here isn't like a beer joint in the States. Young and old alike congregate there to talk, play darts or drink anything from lemonade to Scotch. Usually singing isn't allowed in most of them—you know how reserved the English people are. There are several rooms in the pubs over here with fireplaces in each room. They remind me of lodges such as you sometimes see in the movies and some are quite homey.</p>

		<p>Not that you understand what a pub is I'll continue. I didn't want you to get the idea I had turned into a sot since coming over here. I like a few beers and it's nothing new as we have it in the refrigerator at home all the time.</p>

		<p>On our second stop we ran into the other two fellows from the train and therein lies my tale. Both of them are close buddies of mine and each had a girl with him. The one has been going out with a little Welsh girl who works in one of the colleges here only as in all such cases misunderstandings occur and he was in the doghouse. Who should walk in but this very girls with a girlfriend. They sat at the very next table to Joe & Johnny. Johnny didn't know what to do or say so he said to me, "Take care of her, Johnny." Is this getting you mixed up having two guys with the same name?</p>

		<p>Paul and Lea were calling me to leave so I left with them as they turn up if I leave when we're out to-gether. We went around to the back of the hotel for about a half hour. Everything was quiet when we went in but far from it when we left. The three of us got out in the middle of the room and started singing. We soon had everyone joining in the chorus and left the people in the place in a better frame of mind if I do say so myself.</p>

		<p>Our next stop was back in the front of the hotel where Johnny and Joe were. Linda (John's girl) and her girl friend had hour infantry Joes at their table and Johnny was looking like a wet week so after Paul and I rendered the Transportation Corp Song (by the way singing is definitely not allowed at this hotel but we sang with no complaints—maybe it was my melodious voice, remember how I used to try it on you occasionally. You said I could whistle better). Anyway, after our rendition I pulled up a chair by Linda, introduced myself (I had never met her) and started talking. The infantry gave me some dirty looks but that didn't bother me. To make a long story short I finally managed to get her to walk home with Johnny, who was all alone by that time. So you see, I did my good turn for the day. Are you proud of me, honey? Johnny is twenty and Linda is nineteen—just about the same age difference as between you and me, only you're prettier and sweeter. I was talking to Lea Sunday nite, after we came in, about the girls you meet while in the service. We both agreed that the more we saw the more we appreciated our girls back home & I do mean you.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, we knocking off another run or I should say last nite as we didn't get to bed until 1 A.M., up again six hours later to work on the train. To-night, I'm taking over the office again until eleven o'clock and that brings us up to-date for now.</p>

		<p>I'm enclosing five snaps. Two are of places you should recognize, two are just to give you an idea of what things are like over here and of course the last is the group picture. </p>

		<p>For nine pages I guess I've told you very little honey, however, this extra sheet will serve to let you know that I still love you as much as ever if not more. I'll be damned glad when I don't have to write anymore and can say what I want to in person. Until then remember you are always in my heart. Now hoping you are well I'll leave you with the above thought.</p>

		<p class="sig">All my love,</p>
		<p class="sig">Johnny</p>
