		<p>Dearest Geraldine,</p>

		<p>This will probably be one of the last if not the last letter I'll get to you this year. I don't know if my epistle of Nov. 8 scared you or not but I haven't heard from you in at least a month. I realize that my mail is long winded in arriving and you have a heavy correspondence list but—say, I've just through what is probably the matter—you had a relapse after gazing at the picture I sent you. I send you my condolences.</p>

		<p>We've been in our stable now for two days—correction—three days, however we will be going out again to-morrow.</p>

		<p>I actually managed to get into town on Friday night to see a movie. It was "The Canterville Ghost" with Charles Laughton and Robert Young. Charles was his usual entertaining self. There was a young girl by the name of Margaret O'Brien I believe it was. She was the cutest child star I've seen since the days when Shirley Temple was the rage.</p>

		<p>Our weather is the usual—you know what that means by this time.</p>

		<p>So far I haven't heard one Christmas carol. Either they don't go in for that kind of stuff over here or else I just haven't been around at the right time. I did see one sign of the season yesterday when I went to the hospital for a haircut, namely, holly wreaths on the doors. I think that the less we're reminded about it while over here, the better. I seldom can remember what day it is. That isn't my personal failing as it prevails among most of us especially when we're busy.</p>

	<p>Here's another little verse out of the Stars & Stripes, the daily newspaper of U. S. Forces. — To keep our ships on an even keel, takes tons and tons of corset steel, the die is cast, their fate is written, Now our ladies bulge for Britain. They bulge over here too.</p>

	<p>Well things are going much the same as far as I'm concerned so I can't tell you anything you don't already know. Nearly everyone is in to-night in order to get a good night's sleep on preparation for to-morrow. One fellow is keeping us entertained by playing records through the radio speaker. All the conveniences of home you know, more or less. We're a heck of a lot more fortunate than Joes in other outfits. As I've said before, I'll be spoiled when I get back with my boys.</p>

<p>Now like the Arab I'll fold my tent and silently steal away. Best wishes for a Happy New Year once again. Pardon me if I repeat myself but if the new year is anything like the old one it will stand for & need many good wishes.</p>

<p>I hope you are well, Toots. Don't work too hard at work or play.</p>

		<p class="sig">Love,</p>
		<p class="sig">Johnny</p>
