	<h1>Americans in Britain</h1>
		<p>During World War Two, American soldiers flooded into Britain to prepare for departure to the continent, to maintain supply networks, to fly missions from airbases along the coast, and numerous other activities that occupied soldiers during wartime. If soldiers were stationed in Britain long enough, they would be able to take their leave, usually on weekends, to explore the countryside and experience the local culture in England, Wales, and Scotland.</p>
		<p>For men who were accustomed to living in the United States, Britain was a mix of sights and activities that were simultaneously familiar and strange. The need for manpower in the war against Germany meant that American men were entering the country in large numbers for the first time in U.S. history.</p>
