		<p>Dear Geraldine,</p>

		<p>I was pleased to receive two more letters from you today. These were only three weeks on the way.</p>

		<p>Today we had the afternoon off so my buddy and I came to this town to do some sightseeing and shopping. I should say we attempted to do the latter, as we found it impossible. The just isn't anything for sale which is suitable as a gift. We ran into several Joes on similar quests and they were equally unlucky. We are pretty disgusted at present, believe me.</p>

		<p>We went into one shop to buy some Xmas cards. That proved difficult too. Apparently the British go in for calendars rather than cards. The cards they do have depend on their message from the picture on the frontispiece rather than on the verse. Personally, I like a nice verse rather than a pretty picture. No doubt I inherited that from my mother.</p>

		<p>While in the store, which was also a novelty shop, I noticed a lieutenant examining some lapel ornaments. She bought one so I went up and asked her if they had any feminine appeal. She said they were quite unusual and the only thing she had seen in town which she liked so I asked her to pick you one out. Now my problem is mailing it without getting it squashed. It's only a couple of inches wide and very flimsy so I'll have to make a box for it. This is not a present, by the way, just something to remember me by. Since it appealed to the lieut I thought you might like one as a sort of souvenir.</p>

		<p>After leaving the store, we visited the town's cathedral, the centre of interest of any English town. I won't take the time to describe it in this letter, suffice it to say that it was very beautiful. The only thing I don't like about their churches is their habit of burying people under the floor with a small tablet saying so and so lies underneath. I don't like walking over tombs. We met the Lt. in the church again and stayed for a short service which ended at five o'clock. Now my buddy and I are in the Red Cross and have just finished our meal. I'm writing this before we go out to a show.</p>

	<p>Say, I didn't know you were twenty-two. Hells bell, I'm only twenty-three myself and figured you were a couple of years younger! You must have had a birthday recently. Congrats!</p>

	<p>I'm re-reading your letters now so I can comment on them. to begin with, I agree most heartily that Harold is a lucky fellow. He's following a good course if he goes after a BS in chemistry.</p>

<p>I don't know who you thought would tell me about your male interests as you're the only one I hear from in Sarnia with the exception of my Unc. Anyhow, all I have to say about it is that if you always think before you leap, you'll not go far wrong.</p>

<p>Your fortune telling visit was quite interesting even though I don't believe in those guys. He did a good job of leaving me out of the picture didn't he but you my friend did that long ago, doggone it. Thanks for thinking of me anyway.</p>

<p>I must have given you a wrong impression about those gray hairs. It's true I have some as white as the new driven snow but you can't notice them when my hair is cut short, at least I don't think you can.</p>

<p>My mom misses me naturally, however, she's doing O.K. according to my aunt who saw her in October. Why don't you drop her a line sometime if you want to? She always did like you and said more than once it was too bad you didn't live closer to Buffalo.</p>

<p>Well you should soon have the picture I sent you. I doubt if you noticed much change in my appearance. It doesn't show in a photo, besides I haven't changed much. I look different now than in the snap because of the weight I lost which was fourteen pounds.</p>

<p>Well, my chum is impatiently tapping his feet so I must rush. Thanks a million for writing and I hope you don't mind my doing the following, namely sending you my love. You can always take it in a brotherly way, you know, and so I remain affectionately, </p>

		<p class="sig">As ever,</p>
		<p class="sig">Johnny</p>
